# TODOs / Ideas

* Remove duplicated / similar code in `Entity`, ~~`Repositotry`~~ and ~~`Controller`~~
  * both (fruits and vegetables) could be stored in the same table
* Controller spec: mock DB connection to have a real unit test - no need to test doctrine
* Import ignores given ID: if this is important we need to consider the ID and hand the case of an already existing ID
* API documentation (e.g. swagger)
